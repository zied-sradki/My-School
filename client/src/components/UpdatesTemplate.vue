              Schools are a gathering place for our community, so it is hard to
              comprehend our new reality of quiet classrooms and darkened
              hallways. However, our role serving the community is more
              important than ever. Our focus has shifted from educating our most
              precious community members to stopping operations so we can
              protect them and our staff members. The Ministry of Education has
              directed all schools to pause educational operations Friday, March
              20, through Friday, March 27. This measure is being taken to
              protect our school staff and keep them safe at home. This pause
              will be treated like a school break â€“ school offices are closed,
              and teachers will respond to inquiries when this operational pause
              has concluded. After that, while classes will still be cancelled,
              our staff will work to answer your questions and provide guidance
              on supporting students. We are awaiting direction from the
              Ministry of Education regarding a supplemental curriculum program
              for students. For now, our division staff has created an
              educational resource page for elementary school families that
              provides numerous links to academic sites appropriate for each
              grade level. We are working on a plan to provide equitable access
              to technology for students who may need it. After the operational
              pause, we will provide more information to families about this. We
              are aware that the closure of our schools will impact students who
              rely on us for nutritious meals. We are working with our community
              partners to address food security for our students and families.
              We have attached a list of community agencies that families can
              access for food services and support. We will continue to provide
              division updates on our website
              www.saskatoonpublicschools.ca/covid19. This page can be accessed
              from all school websites. Individuals who may have concerns about
              their health can call the provincial HealthLine at 811 or use the
              self-assessment tool to determine next steps. Information and
              updates regarding COVID-19 are available on
              www.saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus. We know you have many questions.
              Our school division is continuing to work through the details with
              the Ministry of Education and pass along direction to our teachers
              and administrators. These are unprecedented circumstances we are
              working through and we want to ensure we are doing what is best
              for all students. We will provide more information as it becomes
              available. For now, please take care of yourself and your loved
              ones. Sincerely, Barry MacDougall, Director of Education Saskatoon
              Public Schools
